# TODO: Implement Button to Open Form for Entering Schedule

## Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Modify app/index.tsx to import Modal from react-native and add necessary state (modal visibility, list of schedules)
- [ ] Add a button in app/index.tsx that opens the modal when clicked
- [ ] Inside the Modal component in app/index.tsx, add form fields (TextInput for kegiatan and waktu) and a save button
- [ ] Implement save functionality: on save, add the entered schedule to the list, close the modal, and update the display
- [ ] Display the list of schedules in app/index.tsx
- [ ] Test the functionality to ensure the button opens the form, form saves data, and list updates
